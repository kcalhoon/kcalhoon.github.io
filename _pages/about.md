I help organizations unlock value through data and AI implementation. Drawing from my experience at Bain, eBay, Mitsubishi, Forrester, and Ritchie Bros, I bring a blend of global business acumen and hands-on AI expertise to every engagement.

My approach aligns data science strategy with business objectives, emphasizing the human and process components that drive AI success. I build sustainable results through diligence and continuous improvement, helping clients identify high-impact use cases that deliver measurable ROI.

I have an MBA from Harvard, a Graduate Certificate in Data Mining from Stanford, and an undergraduate degree from Pomona College.
