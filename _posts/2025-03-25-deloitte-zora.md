A harbinger of companies expanding in the age of AI? Deloitte deploys its finance and accounting expertise and leverages NVIDIA's ecosystem to enter the AI agent space

<!--more-->

I've written about the need for companies to leverage AI to get more productive, empower employees, and strategically invest in AI to broaden revenues and competitive moat. Deloitte's recent launch of its finance agent Zora is an interesting example of applying its expertise to create agents by partnering with industry bonafides and with privacy/security in mind. Why?

Deloitte has deep expertise, obviously, in finance and accounting. Agents are an interesting way of applying that functional expertise at scale. It likely hopes this will lock in existing customers and expose them to new ones.

Pursuing open source implementations, via NVIDIA's AI ecosystem, directly addresses potential obsolescence and security concerns. NVIDIA's new AgentIQ toolkit is an open source approach to building scalable agents solutions. The company's Nemotron delivers a variety of open source and tuned models, including recently launched reasoning models, that can be deployed in the cloud, on premise, and in virtual private clouds â€” this provides flexibility to upgrade and tune models and control over data privacy.

Partnering with NVIDIA brings instant credibility and a sense of neutrality.

From a product launch perspective, it feels like a good marriage of their accounting and finance expertise with the technical offerings of NVIDIA to address performance and privacy market needs. Deloitte uses the agents internally and claims cost reductions of 25% and productivity improvements of 40%. It will be interesting to see what traction they get.
