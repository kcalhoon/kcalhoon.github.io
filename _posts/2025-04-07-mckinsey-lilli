The platform's foundation rests on four essential pillars:
* Running high-performance teams
* Deploying AI-enhanced client engagements
* Delivering exceptional client service
* Ensuring superior post-project communications

This evolution exemplifies McKinsey's vision of tomorrow's consultant: technology-empowered professionals who channel their expertise into implementing insights rather than merely generating them.
