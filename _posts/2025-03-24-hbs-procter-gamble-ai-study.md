Harvard Business School and P&G tested, across 776 Commercial and R&D professionals, the impact of AI on something P&G is masterful at: new product innovations. The study tested the results for individuals and teams with AI and without AI. The results are clear:

  * Individuals with AI performed as well as traditional teams without AI
  * Teams with AI were 3x more likely to produce top-tier solutions
  * AI particularly raised the performance of those less familiar with the P&G process
  * AI led to more balanced solutions: those with commercial backgrounds developed more technical solutions and vice-versa
  * Those who worked with AI were more positive about the process and reported less anxiety and frustration
  * AI-enabled participants completed tasks 12-16% faster while producing longer, more detailed solutions

These AI participants received just one hour of training on using GPT-4. So the investment to achieve these returns is negligible. It's an AI ROI no-brainer that suggests AI can serve as a genuine collaborative partner, not just another productivity tool.
