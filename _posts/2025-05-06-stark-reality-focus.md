While AI experimentation abounds, achieving enterprise-wide results demands methodical implementation and systematic scaling. Despite 78% of companies using AI in at least one function, only 1% of U.S. companies have successfully scaled their investments, with most seeing modest returns - cost savings under 10% and revenue growth below 5% according to McKinsey.

Highlighted in a Wall St Journal article, 1-800Accountant demonstrates disciplined implementation success. Their AI solution now handles 65% of customer inquiries at human-equivalent quality, routes 30% to representatives, with remaining interactions concluding naturally. This eliminated scheduling hour-long appointments for basic inquiries, driving clear returns under their fixed-rate pricing.

CTO Ryan Teeples attributes their success to segmenting work into measurable components tied to specific KPIs and ROI metrics. This aligns with insights from economist Erik Brynjolfsson and HP's chief data analytics officer Scott Hallworth, who emphasizes defining concrete outcomes before selecting AI models. J&J has had a similar experience (see post https://lnkd.in/g6EgbbUN).

The path forward requires the same focused attention as any major business initiative: identify appropriate use cases, refine system performance, and execute comprehensive business transformation. Unlocking AI's immense potential demands orchestrated effort across the enterprise.
