I was initially skeptical about this top 50 list produced by Forbes, Sequoia, and Meritech Capital — are the 50 just the two venture firms' portfolio companies? Langchain is on the list, but where is crewAI or Galileo or ?

Surely not definitive, but it is a helpful starting point as enterprises make sense of the AI vendor landscape.
