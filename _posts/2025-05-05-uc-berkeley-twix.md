Extracting good data out of complex PDFs is a fundamental challenge and will take multiple approaches. This UC Berkeley team turned the problem upside down, and created an (open source) approach highlighting several aspects that all good AI applications will have: 
* Use LLMs where it makes sense and use other mature tools where they excel
* Improve reliability by providing needed guidance: in this approach, locking down the data needed via the document template opens up improvement for tool use, speed, latency, and cost improvements
* Engage humans where helpful: the human investment in validating/modifying the above-mentioned template enables the significant downstream benefits.
