Will the new Anthropic and Databricks agent-based partnership meet enterprise needs?

<!--more-->

Last month I wrote about Anthropic's focus on business customers they estimate are more likely to spend generously to build revenue-producing apps. Their own research shows that, aside from knowledge workers, 92% of the US workforce accounts for only 12% of Anthropic's Claude usage. Half the company's salesforce is focused on enterprise sales, according to the Wall Street Journal.

The tie-up with Databricks and their 10,000 customers makes sense. The combination puts together data and AI so they can better compete with Microsoft, Amazon, and Google. The two expect to drive $100 million in revenue in the next five years. Databricks has also been investing heavily in its AI capabilities.

This deal focuses on the essentials of AI deployment in building domain-specific and revenue-generating apps. Enterprises will bring their company-specific know-how, while the partnership will address key implementation challenges such as the availability of quality data for fine-tuning and production and the reliability of agents.

Data is core and hard to move. If the two companies get it right, they can pull in new customers while reducing the risk of losing others to the integrated competitors. They will need to address the privacy and security concerns of customers looking for open-source solutions and on-premises or VPC implementation.
