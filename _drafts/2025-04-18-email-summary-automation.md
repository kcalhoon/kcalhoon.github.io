I agree and have built valuable tools to help me write and stay current on AI more efficiently. 

One of the most helpful is my email_summary_automation.

Every morning, I receive a custom email generated via GitHub Actions and Claude that:

• Scans specific Gmail folders for new industry newsletters
• Identifies AI-related content
• Summarizes each relevant email in a few sentences
• Delivers a neatly formatted digest

I find a curated list of email newsletters to be one of the best sources of quality content. This tool facilitates this by allowing me to simultaneously expand my list of sources and process them efficiently to find the gems I'm looking for.
